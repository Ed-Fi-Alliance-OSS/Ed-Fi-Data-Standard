# Security

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one, please report it
privately.

We prefer that you use the [GitHub mechanism for privately reporting a
vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
Under the [main repository's security
tab](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Data-Standard/security), click "Report a
vulnerability" to open the advisory form.

If you have any further concerns that are not addressed by this process, please
submit a case through the [Ed-Fi Community Hub](https://success.ed-fi.org)
