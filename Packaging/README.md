# Ed-Fi Data Standard Sample XML Files

This package contains sample Descriptors and the small set of fake school data
known as the "Grand Bend" data, formatted as XML files. These files can be
loaded into an Ed-Fi API in bulk using the Client Bulk Loader utility from the
ODS/API Platform. The "partial" directory contains a small sub-set of the files,
useful for rapid testing of a small but diverse set of endpoints.k
